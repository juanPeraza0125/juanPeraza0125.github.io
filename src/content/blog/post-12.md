Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework created by Adam Wathan, Jonathan Reinink, David Hemphill, and Steve Schoger. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation, which provide pre-designed components, Tailwind CSS offers a set of utility classes that you can apply directly to HTML elements.
