## **¿Qué es la ingeniería de plataformas?**
#### **- (Nicolas Parra)**

Start by thoroughly understanding the specific requirements of your web project. Consider factors such as the project's scope, complexity, and the features you need. Ask questions like:

- What is the project's purpose?
- What are the key functionalities it should have?
- Are there any specific technical or performance requirements?

## **Evolución y propósito en la industria tecnológica**
#### **- (Fabricio Flores)**

Determine your preferred technology stack. This includes choices for the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend (programming language, database), and any other technologies you plan to use. Your framework should align with your chosen tech stack.
